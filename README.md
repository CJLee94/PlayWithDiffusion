# Project Title: Denoising Diffusion Experiments

## Description

This repository is dedicated to experimenting with and exploring the capabilities of denoising diffusion models. Starting from scratch, it aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how denoising diffusion works and its applications in generating high-quality synthetic images.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

- Python 3.8+, PyTorch 1.7.1, CUDA 10.2 (for GPU support), etc.
